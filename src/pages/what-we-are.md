# What we are

<p>
  Poesis is an intergenerational community space which invites people to gather
  and explore what is means to be human at this time of profound planetary
  change.
</p>
<p>
  We have a need to be connected; to ourselves, to each other and to the wider
  natural world; a need to feel whole and for our lives to make sense and have
  meaning.
</p>
<p>
  It is a place provides the space to reflect, contemplate, connect, cultivate,
  be curious, imagine, innovate, heal, as well as develop radical ideas for
  cultural and societal change.
</p>
<p>
  It intends to provide a home for those searching to make sense of our current
  reality and wanting to make a difference through their own lives.
</p>
<p>
  It does this through a combination of activities and practices, supporting us
  to share collective experiences, collaborate, deepen insight and to be part of
  a healthy living culture.
</p>
<p>
  This is all in service of contributing to the paradigm shift needed in the
  world, recognising that we are all deeply interconnected and part of the web
  of life along with the more-than-human world.
</p>
<p>
  Poesis is an emerging project, it will develop over time with the involvement
  of those connected to it.
