## Network

Poesis has taken inspiration from [Kairos in London](https://www.kairos.london). Poesis will
share Kairos’ starting point that we are entering a period of unprecedented
transformation and planetary change, and we intend to share the intention to be a
space for those wanting to explore topics that emerge from this. We hope that this
can be the start of a network of similar spaces in every city.
