**Poesis** will provide a place for people to gather, connect and share, to make sense of the world and our shared predicaments, though;

### Re-view

- Activities that invite reflection, dialogue and action
- Activities that educate, stimulate and challenge us

_e.g. Talks from thought leaders, dialogue workshops_

### Re-connect

- Activities that nurture creativity, play, art, music, dance, storytelling
- Practices that help us connect to ourselves, others, the wider world (physically, mentally, spiritually), and to what matters

_e.g. Community folk sessions, young person clay sessions_

### Re-nurture

- Practices that cultivate contemplation and imagination
- Activities that feed us both metaphorically and literally

_e.g. Long table community lunches, mindul meditation_

Where we can be inspired by the wonder of the world and for new ways of being in relationship to emerge.

## Who the activities and practices will be for

- Individuals of all ages
- Organisations societally focussed
- Community
