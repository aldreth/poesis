## Direction of travel

To contribute to cultural change in response to this time of profound planetary change by creating an intergenerational community space in York, that feels like home, and invites contemplation, exploration, imagination and action for people in York and the surrounding areas and cities; connected to a wider network of people and organisations doing similar things.

## Strands of work

Poesis provides a place for people to gather, connect and share, to make sense of the world and our shared predicaments, though;

### Re-view

    activities that invite reflection, dialogue and action

    activities that educate, stimulate and challenge us

### Re-connect

    activities that nurture creativity, play, art, music, dance, storytelling

    practices that help us connect to ourselves, others, the wider world (physically, mentally, spiritually),  and to what matters

### Re-nurture

    practices that cultivate contemplation and imagination

    activities that feed us both metaphorically and literally

Where we can be inspired by the wonder of the world and for new ways of being in relationship to emerge.



## Who the activities and practices will be for

    Individuals of all ages

    Organisations societally focussed

    Community
