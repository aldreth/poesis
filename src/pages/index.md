**Poesis** will be a space of invitation… to explore what it means to be human at this point of profound planetary change; using our hands, heart and soul, as well as our relationship with systems and society.

It is a community project in the process of being set up and seeking funding.

If you would like to be involved, attend events/activities when we set-up or would like to fund us, please get in touch with <a href="mailto:fay@insightspace.co.uk">Fay Andrews-Hodgson</a>.
